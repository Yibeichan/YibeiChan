I am a Ph.D student at the University of California, Santa Barbara working in the [Media Neuroscience Lab](https://www.medianeuroscience.org/). My research incorporates media effects, cognitive neuroscience, and computational methods. Primarily, I am interested in how human brain process narratives (e.g., stories, movies) at a fine-grained level, such as how our brain accumulates information to form understandings and how those understandings are shaped by pre-existed beliefs and, therefore, differentiate as the narrative evolves.
