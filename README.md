I am a Ph.D. candidate from the Department of Communication, the University of California, Santa Barbara. My research incorporates cognitive neuroscience, media effects, and computational methods. Primarily, I am interested in how the human brain processes narratives (e.g., stories, movies) at a fine-grained level, such as how our brain accumulates information to form understandings, how pre-existing beliefs shape those understandings, differentiate as the narrative evolves, and how our brain utilize social and non-social information in decision making.

I am also passionate about creating reproducible, re-executable neuroimaging analytical pipelines that will serve for open science. I worked as a GSoC contributor on [converting existing scientific workflows to Pydra](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/LE7kvNMh) and have contributed to [Pydra Tutorial](https://github.com/nipype/pydra-tutorial) in Summer 2022 and was selected as a [ReproNim/INCF Training Fellow](https://www.repronim.org/fellowship.html) in 2022-2023.

The third piece of my research area, also my long-standing curiosity, is morality. I used movies to explore how moral components in narratives impact the engagement the audience and found that their brains synchronized more when immoral characters were punished. Along the side, I am intrigued by and working on how media content impacts public opinion about moral topics.
