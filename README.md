I am a Ph.D. candidate from the Department of Communication, the University of California, Santa Barbara. My research incorporates cognitive neuroscience, media effects, and computational methods. Primarily, I am interested in how the human brain processes narratives (e.g., stories, movies) at a fine-grained level, such as how our brain accumulates information to form understandings, how pre-existing beliefs shape those understandings, differentiate as the narrative evolves, and how our brain utilize social and non-social information in decision making.

I am also passionate about creating reproducible, re-executable neuroimaging analytical pipelines that will serve for open science. I worked as a GSoC contributor on [converting existing scientific workflows to Pydra](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/LE7kvNMh) in Summer 2022 and have contributed to [Pydra Tutorial](https://github.com/nipype/pydra-tutorial). I am also a [ReproNim/INCF Training Fellow](https://www.repronim.org/fellowship.html) in 2022-2023.
