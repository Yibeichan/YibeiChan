I am a Ph.D. student from the Department of Communication, the University of California, Santa Barbara, working in the [Media Neuroscience Lab](https://www.medianeuroscience.org/). My research incorporates cognitive neuroscience, media effects, and computational methods. Primarily, I am interested in how the human brain processes narratives (e.g., stories, movies) at a fine-grained level, such as how our brain accumulates information to form understandings and how pre-existing beliefs shape those understandings, differentiate as the narrative evolves.

I am also passionate about creating reproducible, re-executable neuroimaging pipelines that will serve as an efficient [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)(findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) research strategy with clear utility for open science.

The third piece of my research area, my long-standing curiosity, is morality. I used movies to explore how moral components in narratives impact the engagement the audience and found that their brains synchronized more when immoral characters were punished. Along the side, I am intrigued by and working on how media content impacts public opinion about moral topics.
